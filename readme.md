# Art Space App

This is the first Android app that I have build after 9 years break.    
The app is a showcase for trivial state management and UI definition in code.    

UI configuration is the main part with `Surfase, Column, Row, Image, Button` components.  
State management with `remember` and `mutableStateOf` observable is also key to the app.
